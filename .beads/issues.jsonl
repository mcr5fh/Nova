Concurrent audio - auto-pause TTS when recording starts\n9. Long Claude responses - sentence-chunked TTS streaming\n10. High network latency - processing indicators via connection status\n11. Browser denies microphone - permissionDenied state shows text as primary\n12. Multiple tabs - session locking with 'session active elsewhere' error\n13.
