The runCLI function was returning a promise that resolved immediately instead of waiting for the user to exit. The fix wraps the readline prompt loop in a Promise that only resolves when the user types 'exit' or 'quit'. Also added vitest and unit tests for the state-machine module. Files modified: src/cli/index.ts, package.json, src/__tests__/state-machine.test.ts (new). Build and tests pass.","created_at":"2026-01-31T20:45:46Z"}]}
