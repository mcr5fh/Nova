This causes 'missing required ID field' validation errors even though the LLM is returning IDs correctly.\n\n**Root Cause:** Line 54-62 in baml_adapter.go - the conversion struct literal doesn't include ID field mapping.\n\n**Current Code:**\n```go\nresult.Subtasks[i] = engine.SubtaskDefinition{\n    Title:       subtask.Title,\n    Description: subtask.Description,\n    Type:        extractTaskType(subtask.Type),\n    Priority:    int(subtask.Priority),\n    DependsOn:   subtask.Depends_on,\n    // ← Missing: ID field\n}\n```\n\n**Fix:**\nAdd `ID: subtask.Id,` to the struct literal\n\n**Requirements:**\n1.

The skill is now available as /solution-critic:automatic_updater.","created_at":"2026-02-01T18:22:16Z"}]}

{"id":"Nova-p7de","title":"Add cursor-style chat column to Next.js dashboard","description":"Migrate the working chat POC from agent_loop_server/frontend/ to the Next.js dashboard with a polished cursor-style UI. The chat should be a resizable sidebar that connects to the agent WebSocket API.","design":"# Implementation Plan: Cursor-Style Chat Integration\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n### Layout Changes\n- Add a resizable right sidebar to the main dashboard layout\n- Default width: 400px, min: 300px, max: 800px\n- Should persist width preference in localStorage\n- Collapsible with toggle button (icon in header)\n- When collapsed, show thin bar with expand button\n\n### Components Structure\n```\nsrc/\n├── components/\n│   └── chat/\n│       ├── ChatPanel.tsx          # Main chat container (resizable panel)\n│       ├── ChatHeader.tsx         # Header with connection status \u0026 collapse button\n│       ├── ChatMessages.tsx       # Message list with auto-scroll\n│       ├── ChatMessage.tsx        # Individual message renderer\n│       ├── ChatInput.tsx          # Input form with send button\n│       └── index.ts               # Exports\n├── hooks/\n│   ├── useAgentChat.ts            # WebSocket hook (migrated from POC)\n│   └── useChatSession.ts          # Session persistence hook\n└── types/\n    └── chat.ts                    # Message types from API spec\n```\n\n## Implementation Tasks\n\n### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure\n1. **TypeScript types** (src/types/chat.ts)\n   - Define all message types from AGENT_CHAT_WS_API.md\n   - UserMessage, AgentMessage, ToolCall, ToolResult, AgentThinking, Error\n   - WebSocket event types and payloads\n\n2. **WebSocket Hook** (src/hooks/useAgentChat.ts)\n   - Migrate useWebSocket from POC\n   - Add TypeScript support with proper typing\n   - Add session_id support for persistence\n   - Auto-reconnection logic with exponential backoff\n   - Connection state management (connecting, connected, disconnected, error)\n\n3. **Session Persistence Hook** (src/hooks/useChatSession.ts)\n   - Generate/retrieve session_id from localStorage\n   - Store chat history locally for offline viewing\n   - Clear session function\n\n### Phase 2: UI Components\n\n4. **ChatPanel Component**\n   - Resizable panel using react-resizable or custom drag handler\n   - Collapsible state management\n   - Width persistence in localStorage\n   - Smooth transitions when expanding/collapsing\n\n5. **ChatHeader Component**\n   - Connection status indicator (connected/disconnected/error)\n   - Collapse/expand button\n   - Optional: Clear chat button\n   - Styling: Match existing Header component style\n\n6. **ChatMessages Component**\n   - Scrollable message list\n   - Auto-scroll to bottom on new messages\n   - Virtualization for performance (if needed)\n   - Loading states\n\n7. **ChatMessage Component**\n   - Render different message types:\n     * user_message: Right-aligned, blue background\n     * agent_message: Left-aligned, gray background, markdown support\n     * tool_call: Code block style with tool name + args\n     * tool_result: Success/failure indication\n     * agent_thinking: Dim/italic style\n     * error: Red error banner\n   - Syntax highlighting for code blocks\n   - Timestamp display (optional)\n\n8. **ChatInput Component**\n   - Textarea with auto-resize\n   - Send button\n   - Disabled when disconnected\n   - Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd/Ctrl+Enter to send)\n   - Placeholder text updates based on connection state\n\n### Phase 3: Integration\n\n9. **Layout Integration**\n   - Update app/page.tsx to include ChatPanel\n   - Adjust main content area to account for chat width\n   - Ensure responsive behavior (hide chat on mobile?)\n   - Z-index management for overlays\n\n10. **Styling**\n    - Use Tailwind CSS (match dashboard theme)\n    - Dark mode support (use existing color scheme)\n    - Smooth animations for expand/collapse\n    - Message bubble styles similar to Cursor\n    - Monospace font for code/tool content\n\n11. **WebSocket Configuration**\n    - Update next.config.ts to proxy /ws endpoint\n    - Handle WebSocket upgrade correctly\n    - Environment variable for WebSocket URL\n\n### Phase 4: Polish\n\n12. **Advanced Features**\n    - Markdown rendering for agent messages (react-markdown)\n    - Code syntax highlighting (highlight.js or prism)\n    - Copy-to-clipboard for code blocks\n    - Timestamp for each message\n    - Typing indicator while agent is processing\n\n13. **Error Handling**\n    - Connection failure UI\n    - Retry mechanism\n    - Network status detection\n    - Error message display\n\n14. **Testing**\n    - Test all message types rendering\n    - Test reconnection logic\n    - Test session persistence\n    - Test resize/collapse behavior\n    - Test on different screen sizes\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n### WebSocket Proxy\n- Next.js dev server doesn't proxy WebSocket by default\n- Need custom server or use client-side WebSocket with full URL\n- For production: configure nginx/reverse proxy\n\n### Dependencies to Add\n```json\n{\n  \"react-markdown\": \"^9.0.0\",\n  \"react-syntax-highlighter\": \"^15.5.0\",\n  \"@types/react-syntax-highlighter\": \"^15.5.11\"\n}\n```\n\n### Styling Reference\n- POC uses VS Code colors (#1e1e1e, #264f78, etc.)\n- Dashboard uses Tailwind with custom theme\n- Match dashboard's existing color scheme for consistency\n- Use `bg-gray-900`, `bg-blue-600`, etc.\n\n### Session Management\n- Generate UUID for session_id on first visit\n- Store in localStorage: `agent-chat-session-id`\n- Include session_id in all chat messages to server\n- Clear on demand or after timeout\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] Chat panel appears on right side of dashboard\n- [ ] Can collapse/expand chat panel\n- [ ] Can resize chat panel width\n- [ ] WebSocket connects to /ws endpoint\n- [ ] Can send messages to agent\n- [ ] All message types render correctly\n- [ ] Session persists across page refreshes\n- [ ] Auto-scrolls to new messages\n- [ ] Connection status visible\n- [ ] Works on different screen sizes\n- [ ] Matches dashboard visual style","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"14838591+mcr5fh@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-02-01T11:16:43.580375-08:00","created_by":"Ruiters","updated_at":"2026-02-01T11:44:21.138823-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-01T11:44:21.138823-08:00","close_reason":"Feature fully implemented, QA approved, and committed (559cf26).

ConnectionStatus UI Component (program_nova/dashboard/nextjs/src/components/chat/ConnectionStatus.tsx)\n- Visual indicators for all connection states (connected, connecting, disconnected, reconnecting)\n- Network offline indicator with warning styling\n- Reconnection attempt counter with progress display\n- Error message display for connection failures\n- Manual retry button for user-initiated reconnection\n- Responsive design with proper accessibility\n\n### 3. Comprehensive Test Coverage\n- Created useAgentChat.error.test.ts with 7 tests covering:\n  - Max reconnection attempts\n  - Error information tracking\n  - Last error state exposure\n  - Online/offline network detection\n  - Pause reconnection when offline\n  - Clear error on successful connection\n  - Retry with delay reset\n- Created ConnectionStatus.test.tsx with 9 tests covering all UI states\n\n### 4. Verification Results\n- All tests passing (18 tests total for new functionality)\n- No linter errors in new code\n- Backward compatible with existing code\n- Follows TDD approach (tests written first, then implementation)\n\nThe implementation provides users with clear visual feedback about connection status, allows them to manually retry failed connections, and handles network issues gracefully by pausing reconnection when offline.","created_at":"2026-02-01T19:38:48Z"}]}

WebSocket proxy configured in next.config.ts to route /ws to agent loop server (default port 8001)\n2. Environment variable AGENT_LOOP_PORT allows custom port configuration for dev proxy\n3. Client-side NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL env var for production WebSocket URL configuration\n4. Proxy only works in development mode (npm run dev), not in static export\n5.
