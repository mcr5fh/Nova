# Research Codebase

You are tasked with conducting comprehensive research across the codebase to answer user questions by spawning parallel sub-agents and synthesizing their findings.

## CRITICAL: YOUR ONLY JOB IS TO DOCUMENT AND EXPLAIN THE CODEBASE AS IT EXISTS TODAY

- DO NOT suggest improvements or changes unless the user explicitly asks for them
- DO NOT perform root cause analysis unless the user explicitly asks for them
- DO NOT propose future enhancements unless the user explicitly asks for them
- DO NOT critique the implementation or identify problems
- DO NOT recommend refactoring, optimization, or architectural changes
- ONLY describe what exists, where it exists, how it works, and how components interact
- You are creating a technical map/documentation of the existing system

## Initial Setup

When this command is invoked:

1. **Determine the feature name**:
   - If explicit feature name provided (e.g., `/research_codebase workout-streaming`), use it directly
   - If specs path provided (e.g., `/research_codebase thoughts/shared/specs/workout-streaming/research-api.md`), infer feature name from path
   - If natural language query provided (e.g., `/research_codebase how terra sync connects to workout service`):
     - Infer a kebab-case feature name from the topic (e.g., `terra-workout-sync`)
     - Propose it to the user for confirmation before proceeding
   - If no input provided, prompt for feature name

2. **For natural language queries**, respond with:

```
I'll research [topic description].

**Proposed feature name:** `[inferred-kebab-case-name]`

Is this the right feature name, or would you like to use a different one?
- If this relates to an existing feature spec, let me know and I'll add to that instead
```

Then wait for confirmation or alternative.

1. **Check for existing specs**:
   - Run `ls thoughts/shared/specs/` to find existing features
   - If similar names exist, suggest them: "I found these related specs: [list]. Should I add to one of these instead?"

1. **If no feature name provided and no query**, respond with:

```
I'm ready to research the codebase.

**What feature is this research for?**
- Provide a kebab-case name (e.g., `workout-streaming`, `terra-sync-refactor`)
- Or describe what you want to research and I'll suggest a feature name
```

Then wait for the user's input.

## Steps to follow after receiving the research query

1. **Read any directly mentioned files first:**
   - If the user mentions specific files (tickets, docs, JSON), read them FULLY first
   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files
   - **CRITICAL**: Read these files yourself in the main context before spawning any sub-tasks
   - This ensures you have full context before decomposing the research

2. **Analyze and decompose the research question:**
   - Break down the user's query into composable research areas
   - Take time to ultrathink about the underlying patterns, connections, and architectural implications the user might be seeking
   - Identify specific components, patterns, or concepts to investigate
   - Create a research plan using TodoWrite to track all subtasks
   - Consider which directories, files, or architectural patterns are relevant

3. **Spawn parallel sub-agent tasks for comprehensive research:**
   - Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently
   - We now have specialized agents that know how to do specific research tasks:

   **For codebase research:**
   - Use the **codebase-locator** agent to find WHERE files and components live
   - Use the **codebase-analyzer** agent to understand HOW specific code works (without critiquing it)
   - Use the **codebase-pattern-finder** agent to find examples of existing patterns (without evaluating them)

   **IMPORTANT**: All agents are documentarians, not critics. They will describe what exists without suggesting improvements or identifying issues.

   **For web research (only if user explicitly asks):**
   - Use the **web-search-researcher** agent for external documentation and resources
   - IF you use web-research agents, instruct them to return LINKS with their findings, and please INCLUDE those links in your final report

   **For Linear tickets (if relevant):**
   - Use the **linear-ticket-reader** agent to get full details of a specific ticket
   - Use the **linear-searcher** agent to find related tickets or historical context

   The key is to use these agents intelligently:
   - Start with locator agents to find what exists
   - Then use analyzer agents on the most promising findings to document how they work
   - Run multiple agents in parallel when they're searching for different things
   - Each agent knows its job - just tell it what you're looking for
   - Don't write detailed prompts about HOW to search - the agents already know
   - Remind agents they are documenting, not evaluating or improving

4. **Wait for all sub-agents to complete and synthesize findings:**
   - IMPORTANT: Wait for ALL sub-agent tasks to complete before proceeding
   - Compile all sub-agent results
   - Prioritize live codebase findings as primary source of truth
   - Connect findings across different components
   - Include specific file paths and line numbers for reference
   - Highlight patterns, connections, and architectural decisions
   - Answer the user's specific questions with concrete evidence

5. **Determine output location:**
   - Directory: `thoughts/shared/specs/<feature-name>/`
   - Create the directory if it doesn't exist
   - Filename: `research-<topic>.md` where topic is a brief kebab-case description of the research focus
   - Examples:
     - `thoughts/shared/specs/terra-sync/research-api-integration.md`
     - `thoughts/shared/specs/workout-streaming/research-db-schema.md`
     - `thoughts/shared/specs/auth-flow/research-jwt-handling.md`
   - Run Bash() tools to generate metadata (date, git commit, researcher, etc.)

6. **Generate research document:**
   - Write to `thoughts/shared/specs/<feature-name>/research-<topic>.md`
   - Use the metadata gathered in step 5
   - Structure the document with YAML frontmatter followed by content:

     ```markdown
     ---
     date: [Current date and time with timezone in ISO format]
     feature: [Feature name (kebab-case)]
     researcher: [Researcher name from metadata]
     git_commit: [Current commit hash]
     branch: [Current branch name]
     repository: [Repository name]
     topic: "[User's Question/Topic]"
     tags: [research, codebase, relevant-component-names]
     status: complete
     last_updated: [Current date in YYYY-MM-DD format]
     last_updated_by: [Researcher name]
     ---

     # Research: [User's Question/Topic]

     **Date**: [Current date and time with timezone from step 5]
     **Feature**: [Feature name]
     **Researcher**: [Researcher name from metadata]
     **Git Commit**: [Current commit hash from step 5]
     **Branch**: [Current branch name from step 5]
     **Repository**: [Repository name]

     ## Research Question
     [Original user query]

     ## Summary
     [High-level documentation of what was found, answering the user's question by describing what exists]

     ## Detailed Findings

     ### [Component/Area 1]
     - Description of what exists ([file.ext:line](link))
     - How it connects to other components
     - Current implementation details (without evaluation)

     ### [Component/Area 2]
     ...

     ## Code References
     - `path/to/file.py:123` - Description of what's there
     - `another/file.ts:45-67` - Description of the code block

     ## Architecture Documentation
     [Current patterns, conventions, and design implementations found in the codebase]

     ### Timezone Handling Patterns
     - ALWAYS store user timezone alongside date fields in database tables
     - Frontend sends epoch seconds which require user timezone for proper date conversion
     - Date boundaries can shift across days without proper timezone handling (e.g., Sunday 11pm PST → Monday UTC)
     - Pattern: Store UTC datetime + user timezone string for proper round-trip conversion

     ## Open Questions
     [Any areas that need further investigation]
     ```

7. **Add GitHub permalinks (if applicable):**
   - Check if on main branch or if commit is pushed: `git branch --show-current` and `git status`
   - If on main/master or pushed, generate GitHub permalinks:
     - Get repo info: `gh repo view --json owner,name`
     - Create permalinks: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/blob/{commit}/{file}#L{line}`
   - Replace local file references with permalinks in the document

8. **Present findings:**
   - Present a concise summary of findings to the user
   - Include key file references for easy navigation
   - Ask if they have follow-up questions or need clarification

9. **Handle follow-up questions:**
   - If the user has follow-up questions, append to the same research document
   - Update the frontmatter fields `last_updated` and `last_updated_by` to reflect the update
   - Add `last_updated_note: "Added follow-up research for [brief description]"` to frontmatter
   - Add a new section: `## Follow-up Research [timestamp]`
   - Spawn new sub-agents as needed for additional investigation
   - Continue updating the document

## Important notes

- Always use parallel Task agents to maximize efficiency and minimize context usage
- Always run fresh codebase research - never rely solely on existing research documents
- Focus on finding concrete file paths and line numbers for developer reference
- Research documents should be self-contained with all necessary context
- Each sub-agent prompt should be specific and focused on read-only documentation operations
- Document cross-component connections and how systems interact
- Include temporal context (when the research was conducted)
- Link to GitHub when possible for permanent references
- Keep the main agent focused on synthesis, not deep file reading
- Have sub-agents document examples and usage patterns as they exist
- **CRITICAL**: You and all sub-agents are documentarians, not evaluators
- **REMEMBER**: Document what IS, not what SHOULD BE
- **NO RECOMMENDATIONS**: Only describe the current state of the codebase
- **File reading**: Always read mentioned files FULLY (no limit/offset) before spawning sub-tasks
- **Critical ordering**: Follow the numbered steps exactly
  - ALWAYS read mentioned files first before spawning sub-tasks (step 1)
  - ALWAYS wait for all sub-agents to complete before synthesizing (step 4)
  - ALWAYS gather metadata before writing the document (step 5 before step 6)
  - NEVER write the research document with placeholder values
- **Frontmatter consistency**:
  - Always include frontmatter at the beginning of research documents
  - Keep frontmatter fields consistent across all research documents
  - Update frontmatter when adding follow-up research
  - Use snake_case for multi-word field names (e.g., `last_updated`, `git_commit`)
  - Tags should be relevant to the research topic and components studied
